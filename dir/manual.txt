To add items to the live blacklist, type process names
into bl.txt, one item per line.

Ex:

mspaint.exe
iexplore.exe
ribbons.scr

Typing this into bl.txt would ensure that paint, internet explorer, and ribbons
(the ugliest screensaver) can never run on your system.

Use winwin.vbs to start and stop the live blacklist.

If winwin is active when your sytem shuts off, it will come on
automatically when the system starts up again.

Note that winwin is not turned on by default.
To start it, open winwin.vbs and type 'r'.
