# winwin
Simple windows script that will auto kill tasks from a user-generated list

After installing, the user can edit a file named bl.txt to add processes that they never want open.
Once the program is enabled by pressing r in the control panel, any process that matches an item in bl.txt
will be automatically ended. Once turned on, the script also runs automatically on startup.
